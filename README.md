### Purpose of the Document

The purpose of this document is to provide a blueprint for the development of a Government Budget Management System for the Government of Ebonyi State with the aim to provide a comprehensive plan for the system's design, functionality, and implementation. The document will provide a detailed overview of the system, including the system architecture, technology stack, user roles and permissions, functional features, user interfaces, security measures, data management, reporting and analytics, deployment and infrastructure, project timeline, and risks and mitigation strategies.

### Project Overview

The Government Budget Management System is a web-based application that focuses on finance and budget flow for every Ministry, Department, and Agency (MDA) of the government. It aims to streamline the budget management process, from budget upload to expenditure requests, approvals, disbursements, and supplementary budget handling.

The system will serve as a centralized platform for MDAs to manage their budgets, request funding or expenditures, track approvals, and ensure proper financial management. It will provide transparency, efficiency, and accountability in the government's financial operations.

### Objectives

The main objectives of the Government Budget Management System are as follows:

1. Budget Upload: Enable MDAs to upload their budgets into the system, providing details of planned allocations and expenditures.

2. Funding/Expenditure Request: Facilitate the request for funding or expenditure by MDAs, ensuring a standardized process for capturing and reviewing budgetary needs.

3. Approval Workflow: Implement an approval workflow that involves escalating requests to the appropriate units and heads, with each approving authority adding notes or minutes to the request.

4. Disbursement Confirmation: Once approved, make the funds available in a "CanSpend" wallet. The finance head can disburse the funds and create a disbursement number, which is then attached to the request and approvals. The ministry receiving the funds must confirm the disbursement through their back-end, with the fund deducted from their initial budget.

5. Supplementary Budget Request: Allow an MDA to request a supplementary budget if they exhaust their allocated budget. The request will go through the necessary approval hierarchy until the governor approves it.

6. Request to Spend from Other MDAs: Enable an MDA to request permission to spend from the budget of another MDA. The request will follow the standard approval workflow, including governor approval.

7. Executive Budget Adjustment: Provide an option for MDAs to request an increase in their overall budget. If approved, they will need to submit the details to the National Assembly for deliberation and final approval.

The Government Budget Management System aims to improve financial management, enhance accountability, and streamline budgetary processes within the government.

## System Overview <a name="system-overview"></a>

The system overview section provides an understanding of the overall architecture, technology stack, and integration requirements of the Government Budget Management System.

### System Architecture

The Government Budget Management System will follow a web-based client-server architecture. The key components of the system architecture include:

1. **Client Interface:** The front-end interface will be developed using Next.js and React, providing a user-friendly and responsive user interface for accessing and interacting with the system.

2. **Server-Side Logic:** The server-side logic will be implemented using Node.js, which will handle the business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.

3. **Database Management System:** The system will utilize PostgreSQL as the primary database management system for storing budget data, user information, approval workflows, and other relevant data.

4. **Caching System:** Redis will be employed as a caching system to improve performance and handle frequent data retrieval requests, such as user authentication and budget status.

5. **Digital Signing Integration:** The system will integrate with a digital signing solution to facilitate user authentication and authorization. The digital signing solution will be provided by [eMudhra](https://www.emudhra.com/), a know leading provider of digital signing solutions.

### Technology Stack

The technology stack for the Government Budget Management System includes:

1. **Front-End:** Next.js, React, Redux, Material UI, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS

Next.js and React will be utilized for developing the front-end user interface, providing a robust and efficient web application framework with interactive and responsive UI components.

2. **Back-End:** Node.js, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Prisma ORM

Next.js API serverless functionality will serve as the server-side runtime environment, enabling efficient handling of business logic, request processing, and database interactions.

3. **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL will be used as the relational database management system, providing a reliable and scalable solution for storing and managing budget-related data, user information, and system configurations.

4. **Redis:** Redis will act as the caching system, offering fast in-memory data storage and retrieval capabilities, improving performance for frequently accessed data.

5. **Digital Signing:** eMudhra

6. **Deployment:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
